# Experiment-1
## Simple c++ codes.
## Aim - 
Downloading and installing VS Code,(Hello World and Calculator program).
## Apparatus -
Online compiler (programiz)

## Theory - 
These programs introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming:
Hello World: Demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and how to output text to the console.
Sum: Shows how to perform arithmetic operations and calculate the sum of numbers.

## Code - 
### 1. 
```
// sneha diwan
// 23070123126
// entc b2 
// experiment 1 
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
```

### 2.
```
// sneha diwan
// 23070123126
// entc b2 
// experiment 1 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum = 0, diff = 0;
    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    cin >> num2;

    sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << "Sum of given numbers = " << sum << endl;

    diff = num1 - num2;
    cout << "Difference of given numbers = " << diff << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation - 
Hello World: The program includes the necessary header files and uses the standard output stream to print "Hello World" to the console.
Sum: These programs take input from the user, perform arithmetic calculations to find the sum of a number.

## Conclusion -
These basic programs provide a solid foundation for understanding C++ syntax and basic operations. 
They illustrate how to use input/output streams, arithmetic operations, which are essential for complex programming tasks.
