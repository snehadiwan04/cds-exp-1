# Experiment-1
## Simple c++ codes.
## Aim - 
To write simple C++ programs that demonstrate basic operations such as 
printing a message, calculating the sum of numbers.

## Theory - 
These programs introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming:
Hello World: Demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and how to output text to the console.
Sum: Shows how to perform arithmetic operations and calculate the sum of numbers.

## Explanation - 
Hello World: The program includes the necessary header files and uses the standard output stream to print "Hello World" to the console.
Sum: These programs take input from the user, perform arithmetic calculations to find the sum of a number.

## Conclusion -
These basic programs provide a solid foundation for understanding C++ syntax and basic operations. 
They illustrate how to use input/output streams, arithmetic operations, which are essential for complex programming tasks.
